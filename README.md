### In short about this project

It's a simple VOD website, I'm constantly updating it and enhancing it as well as code while learning new patterns and technologies.
I try to practice here many popular technologies and libraries, even though some aren't so necessary here.

### Current technologies:

- React.js
- React Router
- React Query
- Tailwind

## Could be added in the future:

- Adding lazy loading and skeleton layout when loading
- Adding better picture loading
- Restructuring code and making components more generic and reusable
- Better folder structure
- Extracting some page parts into new components
- Making page faster
- Better and more detailed error handling

- Used to have Redux, but React Query was entirely enough, so I removed it.
