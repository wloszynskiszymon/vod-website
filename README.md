### In short about this project

It's a simple VOD website, I'm constantly updating it and enhancing it as well as code while learning new patterns and technologies.
I try to practice here many popular technologies and libraries, even though some aren't so necessary here.

### Current technologies:

- React.js
- Redux.js
- React Router
- Tailwind

## Coming soon:

- Implementing React Query
- Adding lazy loading and skeleton layout when loading
- More pages, filtering genres, tv shows, movies etc.
- More Redux opportunities
- Restructuring code and making components more generic and reusable
- Using even more popular libraries
-
