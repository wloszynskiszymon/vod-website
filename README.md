### About this project

It's a simple front-end website originally build in React + JavaScript, but now it's set up using Next.js + TypeScript. I tried to make it simple and straight forward in order to learn the best React practices and patterns. After one year of coding in React I updated this project in 2024 and massively improved page performance and code.

### Current technologies:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- React Query
- Tailwind

## Could be added in the future:

- Improve loading and error handling
- Further simplify code
- Improve page loading (especially for mobile - caused mostly by the external carousel)
